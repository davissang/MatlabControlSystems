The first file provides the description of a state feedback controller from given transfer function, the provided desired closed loop poles are s = −5 and s = −4 ± 𝑗2√5. tf = 5/(s+1)(s+2)(s+2). 

The 2nd file provides a description of a state feedback controller with the overshoot and settling time provided. tf = 5/(s+1)(s+2)(s+2) and 5% overshoot with 0.5 settling time.

Lastly a demonstration a full state observer design the desired eigenvalues of the 
observer gain matrix are 𝑠 = −5 = and 𝑠 = −2 ± 𝑗4√3.
